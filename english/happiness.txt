# Happiness

do you know what is happiness? do you know why you feel unhappy sometimes. if you answer in Chinese, you may speak unclearly. But if you try to express in English, you will fell slowly, quitely. You will know what you say clearly.
I think english can help me reknow the world. Indeed, i wanna express in english.

Most time i feel unhappy, because i don't know the relationship between world and me. I was confused that time. If i look this world in other eyes, maybe it will be better.

And i am looking forward someone in this world can see my heart here and connect me in this world.
